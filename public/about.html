<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm a beginning web developer in Angela's Bootcamp. After many years of trying to leanr
  to code, I've decided to make the commitment to see this bootcamp through. I will specialize
  in blogging, internet marketing, and cyber security.

<p>I also plan on using the skills I learn in this bootcamp to explore e-commerce businesses.</p>
